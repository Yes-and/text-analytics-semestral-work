# Text Analytics semestral work
We are working with a dataset of various [reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/6000-messengers-reviews-google-play) of different applications on Google Play.

The main file is *text_analytics_processing_and_model.ipynb*, which loads the data, builds a pipeline, exports usable data and trains a language model

This model detects sentiment, and tries to predict, whether a review is positive or negative

Another dataset of Threads reviews on Google Play was added, to enhance the accuracy of the model. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayagopal20/threads-app-reviews-dataset)
